# Escape-Room-Game-CSSIx-2020

This is the final project I completed for the Google-sponsored Computer Science Initiative (CSSI) in 2020.
I collaborated with 2 other team members: Cesar Rugama, Abdiel Quero

## Language
We used the  **p5 JavaScript library** to build an *Escape Room Game*. In this game, the user tries to escape a room, by quickly collected dissapeared squares and then solving the riddle to Escape before the timer runs out.

## Setup
If you would like to setup and run this project, you can download the repository and open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

# Have Fun!
